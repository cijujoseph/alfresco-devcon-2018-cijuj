# Voice Enabled ADF/APS Application with Angular CLI
An example ADF App integrated with WebSpeech API using https://github.com/TalAter/annyang. I have tested this on Chrome. For additional supported browsers please check [this page](https://github.com/TalAter/annyang/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md#which-browsers-are-supported). This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.0

Special thanks to this [post](https://auth0.com/blog/rxjs-advanced-tutorial-with-angular-web-speech-part-1/) too!

## Quick start

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Proxy settings

The template provides certain proxy settings to allow running web application locally without CORS setup.
You can find details in the `proxy.conf.json` file.

List of URLs being proxied:

- `/activiti-app` -> `http://localhost:8080`
